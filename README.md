# ClinVision

Welcome to the static web demo of **ClinVision**.

This project demonstrates the frontend system of our surgical training analytics platform. It allows readers and reviewers to interact with the user interface without requiring a backend server.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: Overview of surgical sessions and training progress.
- **Session Detail**: Interactive video playback and annotation simulation.
- **Comments & Analysis**: View how feedback and AI-driven insights are presented.

## Usage
- This is a **static read-only demo**.
- Authentication and backend API calls are **mocked** to provide a seamless browsing experience.
- The video playback demonstrates the system's capability to handle surgical footage (using sample content).

## Deployment
This demo is hosted on GitHub Pages.
